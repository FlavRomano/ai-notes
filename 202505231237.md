- Mappings on vector spaces that preserve their structure.
- They allow us to define the concept of a coordinate
- One important thing of vector spaces is closure property, 
	- that guarantee that the results from two vectors addition is a vector in the same vector space. 
	- We want to preserve this property when applying the mapping.

Given two real vector spaces $V, W$. A mapping $\Phi:\mathcal{V}\to \mathcal{W}$ preserves the structure of the vector space if 
1. $$ \Phi(x+y) = \Phi(x) + \Phi(y) $$
2. $$\Phi(\lambda x) = \lambda \Phi(x)$$
for all $x,y\in V$ and $\lambda \in\mathbb{R}$. Therefore the mapping is **linear**. 

- We can represent linear mappings as matrices
- A linear mapping can be Injective, Surjective or Bijective.
