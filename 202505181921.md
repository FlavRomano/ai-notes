- flow separates the two forms of effort:
	- concentration on the task
	- deliberate control of attention
- maintaining focused attention on absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, in that way freeing resources to be directed to the task at hand.

C: People can expend considerable effort for extended periods without exerting willpower in a state called "flow." This state is characterized by effortless concentration where individuals become deeply absorbed in an activity, losing their sense of time and self. Flow separates the effort of concentrating on a task from the effort of deliberately controlling attention, freeing up cognitive resources by not requiring the exertion of self-control.
