Similarity of matrices

Two matrices $A, \tilde A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ are **similar** if

$$\exists S \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\mid \tilde A = S^{-1}AS$$

there exists regular matrix $S \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ such that $\tilde A = S^{-1}AS$.

- Similar matrices are always equivalent
	- but equivalent matrices are not necessarily similar.
