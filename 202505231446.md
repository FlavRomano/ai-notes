Finite-dimensional vector spaces $V$ and $W$ are **isomorphic** $\iff$ $dim(V) = dim(W)$

---

- isomorphic means linear and bijective mapping
- theorem states that exists a linear and bijective mapping between two vector spaces of the same dimension
- this means that
	- vector space of the same dimension are kind **the same thing**
	- they can be transformed into each other without **any loss**

In fact we can treat the following vector space the same
- $\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ 
	- vector space of $m\times n$ matrices
- $\mathbb{R}^{mn}$
	- vector space of vectors of length $mn$

There exists a linear, bijective mapping that **transforms one into the other**.

It's obvious that any $n$-dimensional vector space is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.
