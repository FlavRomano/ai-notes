Given $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and a linear mapping $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^m$, $x\mapsto Ax$

$$A = [a_1, ..., a_n]$$
we obtain $$Im(\Phi) = \{Ax\mid x\in \mathbb{R}^n\} = \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i a_i \mid x_i\in\mathbb{R} \right\}$$
this is the set of all linear combination of $A$'s columns vectors. Therefore we got the definition of span.

$$ Im(\Phi) = \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i a_i \mid x_i\in\mathbb{R} \right\} = span[a_1,\ldots,a_n]\subseteq\mathbb{R}^m $$
- So the image is the **span of the columns of $A$**
- This span is know as **column space**
- The column space is the image, is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ where $m$ is the height of the matrix.
- We say that image is spanned by column vectors of $A$.
