Affine subspace are often described by parameters.

Consider $k$-dimensional affine space $L=x_0 + U$ of $V$.

If $(b_1,\ldots,b_k)$ is an ordered basis of $U$ $\implies$ every element $x\in L$ can be *uniquely* described as $$x = x_0 + \lambda_1 b_1+\ldots+\lambda_k b_k$$
$$\lambda_i \in \mathbb{R}\quad i = 1\ldots k$$
this representation is called **parametric equation** of $L$.
- $b_1,\ldots,b_k$ are called **directional vectors**
- $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_k$ are equation **parameters**
