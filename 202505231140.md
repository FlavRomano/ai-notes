Given
- a vector space $V$
- a finite number of vectors $x_i\in V$ with $i=1\ldots k$

If there is a non-trivial linear combination that give us $$\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i x_i = 0 \text{ with at least one } \lambda_i\ne0$$
we can say that vectors $x_1,\ldots,x_k$ are **linearly dependent**

---
If only the trivial solution exists $$\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k=0$$ the vectors $x_1,\ldots,x_k$ are **linearly independent**

- in row-echelon form we know that
	- pivot columns are linearly independent vectors.
	- the non-pivot columns can be expressed as linear combinations of the pivot columns on their left.

in this case the second vector is 3 times the first one, therefore columns are linearly dependent.
