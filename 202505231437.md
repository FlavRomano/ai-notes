Isomorphism is a special case of linear mapping between vector spaces $V$ and $W$. In particular $$\Phi: V\to W$$ is both **linear** and **bijective**

---
An important theorem states that we can treat two vector spaces $V$ and $W$ the same as long as $dim(V) = dim(W)$

If $\Phi: V\to W$ is an isomorphism, then $$\Phi^{-1}: W\to V$$ is an isomorphism too.
