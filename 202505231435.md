Knowing what Injective, Surjective and Bijective mapping are, there are some **special cases** of linear mapping between vector spaces $V$ and $W$:
- Isomorphism
- Endomorphism
- Automorphism
- Identity mapping (identity automorphism)

Given two linear mappings $\Phi: V\to W$ and $\Psi: W\to X$ the composition $$\Phi \circ \Psi : V \to X$$ is also **linear**
