Endomorphism is a special case of linear mapping between vector spaces $V$ and $W$. In particular $$\Phi: V\to W$$ is **linear**.

---
Given two linear mappings $\Phi: V\to W$ and $\Psi: W\to X$ the composition $$\Phi \circ \Psi : V \to X$$ is also **linear**

---
If $\Phi: V\to W$, $\Psi: V\to W$ are linear, then 
- $\Phi + \Psi$
- $\lambda\Phi,\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$

are linear too
