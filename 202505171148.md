Q: What's human physical indicator of mental effort?

E:
- The pupils are indicator of mental effort
- The more is the effort the more pupils will dilate, they dilate more in hard problems
- The size of the pupil varies second by second, reflecting the changing demands of the task. Peak of pupil size coincided with maximum effort.
- It's easy to guess when somebody give up on a mental task just looking by its pupils. i.e During a multiplication pupils dilate, but get contracted immediately when stopped.

C: Pupil dilation serves as a reliable physical indicator of mental effort. The dilation correlates with the intensity of mental effort, with larger dilations observed for more difficult tasks. Furthermore, continuous changes in pupil size reflect the dynamic fluctuations in mental effort during a task, and the timing of pupil contraction can suggest a disengagement from the cognitive activity.
