Q: What's System 2?

E: 
- it's a system in the mind
- allocates attention to the mental activities that demand it
- the main operations are associated with subjective experience task, choice and concentration.
	- operations that does not come naturally.
- it's the way we identify ourselves, a conscious system that makes choices
- all system 2 operations requires attention and are disrupted when attention is drawn away.
	- focus attention on the voice of a particular person in a crowded and noisy room
	- search memory to identify a surprising sound
	- park in a narrow space
	- tell someone your phone number
- programs the normally automatic functions of attention and memory, therefore has the ability to change how System 1 works
- we have a limited budget of attention, we pay attention to do some activities. If we go beyond our budget, we'll fail.
- we can't do multiple difficult activities together
- we can do multiple easy and undemanding activities together.
- intense focusing on a task can make people blind
	- e.g The invisible gorilla.

C: System 2 is the mind's effortful, conscious, and deliberate system responsible for allocating attention to demanding mental activities. It is associated with subjective experiences of agency, choice, and concentration, handling operations that don't come naturally. System 2 requires focused attention and is disrupted when attention is diverted. While having a limited capacity for attention, it can program System 1's automatic functions and is the system with which we identify our conscious, choosing self. Engaging System 2 intensely can lead to cognitive blindness, as demonstrated by examples like the invisible gorilla experiment.
