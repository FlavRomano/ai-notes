Given 
- two vector spaces $V,W$
- with corresponding (ordered) bases $B=(b_1,\ldots,b_n)$ and $C=(c_1,\ldots,c_n)$
- a linear mapping $\Phi: V \to W$ $$\forall j\in \{1,\ldots, n\} \quad \Phi(b_j) = \alpha_{1j}c_1 + \ldots + \alpha_{mj}c_m = \sum_{i=1}^m a_{ij}c_j$$
is the unique representation of $\Phi(b_j)$ with respect to basis $C$.

We call the $m\times n$-matrix $A_\Phi$ whose elements are given by $$A_\Phi(i,j) = \alpha_{ij}$$ the **transformation matrix of $\Phi$** (with respect to the ordered basis $C$ of $W$ and $B$ of $V$).

- The coordinates of $\Phi(b_j)$, $\alpha_{1j}\ldots\alpha_{mj}$, are the $j$-th column of $A_{\Phi}$
