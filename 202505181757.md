Q: Physical activities deteriorates mental capacities? 

E:
- Both mental and physical activities compete for the limited resources of System 2.
- if the physical activity highly demand concentration and cognitive effort then yes
- moving our body requires a mental effort of self-control.
- self-control and deliberate thought draw on the same limited budget of effort.
- maintaining a coherent train of thought requires discipline and self-control, event without time limit.

C: Yes, physical activities can deteriorate mental capacities if they require significant concentration and self-control, as both physical and deliberate mental efforts draw from the same limited budget of attentional resources. Maintaining physical control or a coherent train of thought requires discipline that taps into this shared effort pool (System 2's limited resources).
