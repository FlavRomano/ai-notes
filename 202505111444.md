Q: What's System 1

E:
- is a system in the mind
- operates automatically and quickly
- require little or no effort
- no sense of voluntary control
- it originates impressions and feelings (main sources of explicit beliefs of System 2)
- some activity (in order of complexity)
	- detect that one object is more distant than another
	- orient to the source of a sudden sound
	- make a disgust face when shown a horrible picture
	- answer 2+2
	- drive a car on an empty road
	- understand simple sentences
- has learned associations between ideas
	- e.g "the capital of France" is automatically substitute to Paris
- some skills are acquired only by specialised experts
	- e.g finding the best chess move

C: System 1 is the mind's automatic, fast, and effortless operational mode that operates without voluntary control. It generates immediate impressions, feelings, and intuitions, serving as a primary source for System 2's beliefs and choices. Its activities range from basic perceptions and learned associations (like knowing the capital of France) to highly skilled, automatic responses developed through expertise (like a chess master finding a strong move).
