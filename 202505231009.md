Consider 
- a set $S$
- an operation $\otimes: S\times S \to S$ defined on $G$

We call a **group** $G := (S, \otimes)$ if holds
1. Closure of $G$ under $\otimes$
2. Associativity
3. Neutral element
4. Inverse element, defined with respect to  the operation $\otimes$

The set of regular invertible matrices $A \in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n }$ is a group with respect of "$\cdot$" matrix multiplication. Since matrix multiplication is not commutative , the group is not Abelian.
