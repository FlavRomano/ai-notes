Given linear mapping $\Phi: V\to W$ we define **image** $$Im(\Phi) := \Phi(V) = \{ w\in W\mid \exists v \in V. \Phi(v)=w \}$$
is the set of vectors $w\in W$ that can be **reached by $\Phi$** from **any vector in $V$**.

The rank of matrix $A$ of a linear mapping $\Phi$ is equals to the dimension of the image.
$$rank(A) = \dim (Im(\Phi))$$
