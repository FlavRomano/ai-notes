Given 
- two vector spaces $V,W$
- with corresponding (ordered) bases $B=(b_1,\ldots,b_n)$ and $C=(c_1,\ldots,c_n)$
- a linear mapping $\Phi: V \to W$ $$\forall j\in \{1,\ldots, n\} \quad \Phi(b_j) = \alpha_{1j}c_1 + \ldots + \alpha_{mj}c_m = \sum_{i=1}^m a_{ij}c_j$$

The transformation matrix $A_\Phi (i,j)= \alpha_{ij}$ 
- can be used to map coordinates 
	- with respect to an ordered basis in $V$ 
	- to coordinates with respect to an ordered basis in $W$

In fact, if
- $\hat x$ is the coordinate vector of $x\in V$ with respect of $B$
- $\hat y$ is the coordinate vector of $y = \Phi(x) \in W$ with respect of $C$

then $$\hat y = A_\Phi \hat x$$thanks to $A_\Phi$, I can map $\hat x$ on $B$ in $C$.
