Q: In response to mental overload, who protects the most important activity?

E:
- System 2 does it by allocating spare capacity to other tasks by priority (aka activity demanding)
- System 1 on the other hands takes over in emergencies, assigns total priority to self-protective actions.
- System 2 assigns less priority as we become skilled in a task, because its demand for energy diminishes. Intelligent people need less effort to solve the same problems.
- normally we avoid mental overload by dividing our tasks into multiple easy steps

C: In response to mental overload, System 2 protects the most important activity by prioritising and allocating its limited attentional capacity accordingly, especially for demanding tasks where skill is not yet automatic. Conversely, System 1 can take over in emergencies, assigning total priority to self-preservation actions. As skill increases and tasks become less energy-demanding, System 2 assigns less priority.
