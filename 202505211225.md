- To extract relevant patterns from data, we design ==models== 
- Typically, the designed models are related to the process that generates data
- The goal is to find good models that generalise well to yet unseen data
	- we may care about them in the future.

i.e in a regression setting, the model would describe a function that maps inputs to real valued outputs
