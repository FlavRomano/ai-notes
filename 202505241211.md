Given a linear mapping $\Phi: V\to W$
- it always holds that $\Phi$ 
	- maps the neutral element of $V$ on the neutral element of $W$ $$\Phi(0_V) = 0_W$$
	- so $0_V$ is always inside the Kernel $$0_V\in ker(\Phi)$$
- the image is made of $w\in W$ vectors, therefore $$Im(\Phi)\subseteq W$$ is a subspace of $W$.
- the kernel is made of $v\in V$ vectors, therefore $$ker(\Phi) \subseteq V$$ is a subspace of $V$.
- if the kernel contains only the zero vector, then $\Phi$ is injective because maps one-to-one $$\Phi\text{ injective }\iff \ker(\Phi)=\{0\}$$
