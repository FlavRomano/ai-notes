- Vector subspaces are sets contained in the original vector space
- They are closed
	- when we perform vector space operations on elements within a subspace, we will never leave it

- Let $\mathcal{V}=(\mathcal{V}, +, \cdot)$ be a vector space and $\mathcal{U}\subseteq \mathcal{V}$ with $\mathcal{U}\neq \emptyset$
- Then $U = (\mathcal{U}, +, \cdot)$ is called **vector subspace** of $V$ (or linear subspace) $\iff$ 
	- $U$ is a vector space with the vector space operations $+$ and $\cdot$ restricted to $\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathbb{R}\times\mathcal{U}$
- $U\subseteq V$  inherits many properties from $V$ because they hold $\forall x \in \mathcal{V}\implies x\in\mathcal{U}\subseteq \mathcal{V}$
- Every subspace $U\subseteq(\mathbb{R}^n, +, \cdot)$ is the solution space of a homogeneous system of linear equations $Ax = 0$ for $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$
