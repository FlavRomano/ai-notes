Affine mappings happens between two affine spaces.

---

Given
- two vector spaces $V, W$ 
- a linear mapping $\Phi: V\to W$
- $a\in W$

the following mapping is an **affine mapping** from $V$ to $W$ $$
\begin{array}{l}
\phi: V\to W\\
x\mapsto a + \Phi(x)
\end{array}$$
- the vector $a$ is called **translation vector** of $\phi$

---
Some properties
- If $\phi$ is bijective they keep the geometric structure invariant
- Composition $\phi' \circ \phi$ of affine mappings is affine
- On composition of linear affine mappings, linearity is preserved 

Every affine mapping $\phi:V\to W$ is also the composition of:
1. a linear mapping $\Phi: V\to W$
2. a translation $\tau : W\to W\mid \phi=\tau\circ \Phi$ 

the mappings $\Phi$ and $phi$ are uniquely determined
