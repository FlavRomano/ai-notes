The smallest generating set that spans a vector (sub)space is known as **basis**.

---

Given 
- a vector space $V=(\mathcal{V}, +, \cdot)$
- $\mathcal{A}\subseteq \mathcal{V}$

A generating set $\mathcal{A}$ of $V$ is called **minimal** $\iff$ not exists no smaller set $\tilde A\subsetneq A$ that spans $V$
