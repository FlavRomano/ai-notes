In vector space $V$
- we are interested in sets of vectors $\mathcal{A}$ that possess the following property $$\forall v \in V \mid v = \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_ix_i\quad i=i\ldots k,\; x_i \in \mathcal{A}$$ any vector $v\in V$ can be obtained by a linear combination of vectors in $x\in\mathcal{A}$

Given
- vector space $V = (\mathcal{V}, +, \cdot)$
- set of vectors $\mathcal{A} = \{x_i\}\subseteq\mathcal{V}$ with $i=1\ldots k$

$$\forall v\in \mathcal{V} \mid v = \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i x_i \implies A \text{ generating set of } V$$

If every vector $v \in \mathcal{V}$ can be expressed as linear combination of $x_i$ 
$\implies$ $\mathcal{A}$ is called a **generating set** of $V$

- Generating sets are sets of vectors that span vector (sub)spaces
	- every vector can be represented as a linear combination of the vectors in the generating set
