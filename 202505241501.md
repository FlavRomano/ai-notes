- Affine spaces in machine learning (ML) provide a way to model data using geometric concepts 
	- like points, lines, and planes
- without relying on a fixed origin. 
- They are especially useful in tasks involving 
	- transformations, motions, and trajectories, 
- where the concept of a fixed origin isn't always relevant

Given 
- $V$ a vector space
- $x_0\in V$ vector
- $U\subseteq V$ a subspace

The subset $L$ is called **affine subspace of $V$** $$\begin{array}{l}
L &= x_0 + U\\
&:= \{x_0 + u \mid u\in U\}\\
&= \{ v\in V\mid \exists u\in U.v=x_0 + u \}\subseteq V
\end{array}$$
- $L$ is the set of every $v$ vectors of $V$ 
- that can be expressed as 
	- sum of a fixed vector $x_0\in V$ and any vector $u\in U$ 

- Subspace $U$ is called **direction**
- Fixed vector $x_0$ is called **support point**

The definition of an affine subspace excludes 0 if $x_0\notin U$.
- as a consequences an affine subspace is not a vector subspace of $V$ for $x_0 \notin U$
