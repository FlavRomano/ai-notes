Q: What makes some cognitive operations more demanding and effortful than others?

E:
- effort is required to maintain simultaneously in memory several ideas that 
	- require separate actions
	- or that need to be combined according to some rules
- System 2 is the only one that can compare objects on demand and link them following some rules
- System 1 cannot do anything about them, it's automatic and can capture simple relations

C: Cognitive operations are more demanding and effortful when they require the deliberate, focused attention of System 2, particularly for tasks that involve holding and manipulating multiple pieces of information, applying specific rules, and overriding the automatic responses of System 1. This effort is linked to the limited capacity of working memory and the need for conscious control over thought processes.
