How transformation matrices of a linear mapping $\Phi : V\to W$ change if we change the bases in $V$ and $W$. 

---
For a linear mapping $\Phi: V\to W$, given two ordered bases of $V$:
- $B=(b_1,...,b_n)$
- $\tilde B=(\tilde b_1,...,\tilde b_n)$

and two ordered bases of $W$:
- $C=(c_1,...,c_m)$
- $\tilde C = (\tilde c_1,...,\tilde c_m)$

and a transformation matrix $A_\Phi$ of $\Phi$ with respect to $B$ and $C$.

The corresponding transformation matrix $\tilde A_\Phi$ with respect to the bases $\tilde B$ and $\tilde C$ is given as $$\tilde A_\Phi = T^{-1} A_\Phi S$$
- $S\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is the transformation matrix of $id_V$
	- maps coordinates with respect to $\tilde B$ onto coordinates with respect to $B$
	- the $j$-th column of $S$ is the coordinate representation of $\tilde b_j$ with respect to $B$
- $T\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ is the transformation matrix of $id_W$
	- maps coordinates with respect to $\tilde C$ onto coordinates with respect to $C$
	- the $k$-th column of $T$ is the coordinate representation of $\tilde c_k$ with respect to $C$

With a basis change in $V$ and $W$, the matrix $A$ is replaced by an equivalent matrix $\tilde A_\Phi$.

Consider a mapping $\Phi: V\to W$, and ordered bases $B$, $\tilde B$ of $V$ and $C$, $\tilde C$ of $W$. 

The mapping $\Phi_{CB}$ 
- is an instantiation of $\Phi$ 
- maps basis vectors of $B$ onto linear combinations of basis vectors of $C$

Assume that we know the transformation matrix $A_\Phi$ of $\Phi_{CB}$ with respect to the ordered bases $B$, $C$.
- when we perform a basis change 
	- from $B\to \tilde B$ in $V$ 
	- and from $C\to \tilde C$ in $W$
- we can determine the corresponding transformation matrix $\tilde A_\Phi$

1. We find the matrix representation of the linear mapping $$\Psi_{B\tilde B}: V\to V$$ that maps coordinates with respect to the new basis $\tilde B$ onto the coordinates with respect to the old basis $B$
2. We use the transformation matrix $A_\Phi$ of $\Phi_{CB}:V\to W$ to map these coordinates onto the coordinates with respect to $C$ in $W$
3. Finally we use a linear mapping $$\Xi_{\tilde C C}: W\to W$$ to map the coordinates with respect to $C$ onto coordinates with respect to $\tilde C$
4. We can express the linear mapping $\Phi_{\tilde C \tilde B}$ as a composition of linear mapping that involve the old basis $$ \Phi_{\tilde C \tilde B} = \Xi_{\tilde C C} \circ \Phi_{CB} \circ \Psi_{B\tilde B} = \Xi^{-1}_{C\tilde C} \circ \Phi_{CB} \circ \Psi_{B\tilde B}  $$ we use $\Psi_{B\tilde B} = id_V$ and $\Xi_{C\tilde C} = id_W$, identity mappings that map vectors onto themselves, but with respect to a different basis.
