How transformation matrices of a linear mapping $\Phi : V\to W$ change if we change the bases in $V$ and $W$. 

---
For a linear mapping $\Phi: V\to W$, given two ordered bases of $V$:
- $B=(b_1,...,b_n)$
- $\tilde B=(\tilde b_1,...,\tilde b_n)$

and two ordered bases of $W$:
- $C=(c_1,...,c_m)$
- $\tilde C = (\tilde c_1,...,\tilde c_m)$

and a transformation matrix $A_\Phi$ of $\Phi$ with respect to $B$ and $C$.

The corresponding transformation matrix $\tilde A_\Phi$ with respect to the bases $\tilde B$ and $\tilde C$ is given as $$\tilde A_\Phi = T^{-1} A_\Phi S$$
- $S\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is the transformation matrix of $id_V$
	- maps coordinates with respect to $\tilde B$ onto coordinates with respect to $B$
	- the $j$-th column of $S$ is the coordinate representation of $\tilde b_j$ with respect to $B$
- $T\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ is the transformation matrix of $id_W$
	- maps coordinates with respect to $\tilde C$ onto coordinates with respect to $C$
	- the $k$-th column of $T$ is the coordinate representation of $\tilde c_k$ with respect to $C$

With a basis change in $V$ and $W$, the matrix $A$ is replaced by an equivalent matrix $\tilde A_\Phi$.

Consider a mapping $\Phi: V\to W$, and ordered bases $B$, $\tilde B$ of $V$ and $C$, $\tilde C$ of $W$. 

The mapping $\Phi_{CB}$ 
- is an instantiation of $\Phi$ 
- maps basis vectors of $B$ onto linear combinations of basis vectors of $C$

Assume that we know the transformation matrix $A_\Phi$ of $\Phi_{CB}$ with respect to the ordered bases $B$, $C$.
- when we perform a basis change 
	- from $B\to \tilde B$ in $V$ 
	- and from $C\to \tilde C$ in $W$
- we can determine the corresponding transformation matrix $\tilde A_\Phi$

1. We find the matrix representation of the linear mapping $$\Psi_{B\tilde B}: V\to V$$ that maps coordinates with respect to the new basis $\tilde B$ onto the coordinates with respect to the old basis $B$
2. We use the transformation matrix $A_\Phi$ of $\Phi_{CB}:V\to W$ to map these coordinates onto the coordinates with respect to $C$ in $W$
3. Finally we use a linear mapping $$\Xi_{\tilde C C}: W\to W$$ to map the coordinates with respect to $C$ onto coordinates with respect to $\tilde C$
4. We can express the linear mapping $\Phi_{\tilde C \tilde B}$ as a composition of linear mapping that involve the old basis $$ \Phi_{\tilde C \tilde B} = \Xi_{\tilde C C} \circ \Phi_{CB} \circ \Psi_{B\tilde B} = \Xi^{-1}_{C\tilde C} \circ \Phi_{CB} \circ \Psi_{B\tilde B}  $$ we use $\Psi_{B\tilde B} = id_V$ and $\Xi_{C\tilde C} = id_W$, identity mappings that map vectors onto themselves, but with respect to a different basis.

Due to linearity conservation on linear mapping composition, we can look at basis changes from the perspective of composing linear mappings.

From change of basis matrixes we obtain the concept of
- matrix equivalence
- matrix similarity
