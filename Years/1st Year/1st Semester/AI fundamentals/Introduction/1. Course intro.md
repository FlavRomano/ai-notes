## Some general notions
Challenges with AI:
- software
	- not a problem
	- the opensource communities (e.g hugging face) helps the usage of AI
- data
	- is a problem
	- it's difficult to obtain someone else's data
- talent
	- is a problem
	- AI models require fine tuning
- computational resources
	- AI processes are very expensive in terms of computation

- Deep learning is one approach (subset) of ML
	- utilizes neural networks with multiple layers as an abstraction to learn patterns directly from data.
	- is inspired by the structure and function of human brain
	- enables systems to automatically discover features and relationships
- ML is one approach (subset) of AI
	- enables systems to lear from data and improve their performance on a task WITHOUT being explicitly programmed.
	- focus on developing algorithms that allow computers, based on the data they are trained on, to
		- identify patterns
		- make decisions
		- generate predictions

System1/System2 distinction
- it has been popularized by "Thinking, Fast and Slow"
- describes two distinct modes of thinking that influence our judgments and decisions

System1
- it's Fast Thinking
- operates automatically and quickly, without voluntary control
- it's intuitive and emotional
- relies on HEURISTICS and MENTAL SHORTCUTS
- handles simple routine tasks and generates feelings
	- perceptual tasks
- i.e reacting to a thunderstruck, understanding simple 

System2
- it's Slow Thinking
	- like AI Fundamentals (this course)
- Allocates attention to mental activities that demand it (e.g complex computations)
- It's slower and logical
- Requires concentration and consciousness
	- recalling from memory
- handles unfamiliar tasks, critical analysis
- i.e complex math problems, learning a new skill

ML have some limits:
- Explanation and accountability
	- ML systems can't justify in human terms their results
	- Some regulations requires explanations to prevent discrimination (e.g racial problems, gender gap)
- ML systems learn what's in the data
	- if training data are bad or unfair then will develop bad/unfair models

Symbolic AI
- in mid 1950s the focus of research was on High level (symbolic) human-readable representations of problems 
	- general paradigm
	- searching for a solution
	- knowledge representation
	- reasoning
	- planning
- Is based on one hypothesis formulated by Newell and Simon named "Physical symbol systems Hypothesis" (PSSH)
