- Every linearly independent generating set of $V$ is minimal 
- This kind of generating set is called a **basis** of $V$
- Every vector $x\in V$ is a linear combination of vectors from basis $\mathcal{B}$ 
	- every linear combination is unique with $$x = \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i b_i = \sum_{i=1}^k \psi_i b_i $$ and $\lambda_i,\psi_i\in\mathbb{R}$, $b_i\in\mathcal{B}$ it follows that $\forall\;i\mid\lambda_i=\psi_i$

Vectors from canonical matrix form a basis, the **canonical basis** e.g $\mathbb{R}^3$ ![[Pasted image 20250523121936.png]]
- Every vector space $V$ posses a basis $\mathcal{B}$
- There is no unique basis
- All bases possess the same number of **basis vector**
- The dimension of a vector space $V$ is the number of basis vectors of $V$ $$dim(V)=\#basis\;vectors$$
- if $U\subseteq V$ is a subspace of $V$ $$\begin{array}{l}dim(U)\leq dim(V)\\ dim(U)=dim(V)\iff U=V\end{array}$$
- Dimension of a vector space can be thought of as **the number of independent directions in this vector space**
