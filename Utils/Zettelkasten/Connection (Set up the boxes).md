Is where the notes become USABLE.

Zettekasten creator used two boxes:
1. REFERENCE, contained literature notes categorised by unique id
2. IDEAS, contained permanent notes based on fleeting notes and literature notes

Fleeting notes are not categorized due to a daily reviewing process that produces permanent note.
