Fleeting
- daily thoughts
- disappear very quickly

Literature
- thoughts while consuming content
- i.e books
- captures one atomic idea each
- it's a re-elaboration of the content we consumed
- track the reference of where we encounter the thoughts (i.e chapter of a book, method, hypothesis)

Permanent
- the output of the reviewing process of Fleeting notes and Literature Notes $$permanent = fleeting + literature$$
- one atomic idea per note
	- each note is a building block that we arrange to formulate an idea
- express the idea clearly without assuming any context for the reader
	- to make the system future proof
	- we can't assume that in 10 months we recall everything we studied
