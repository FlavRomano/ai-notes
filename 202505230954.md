- In matrices with row-echelon form as the picture ![[Pasted image 20250523095545.png]]
	- **pivot variables** are $x_1,x_3,x_4$
		- they are called **basic variables**
	- the non-pivot ones are $x_2, x_5$
		- they are called **free variables**

Is easier to determine a particular solution with pivot variables. ![[Pasted image 20250523100104.png]]
- we express the right-hand side of the equation using the pivot columns $$b = \sum_{i=1}^P \lambda_i p_i$$
	- where $p_i$ are the pivot columns
	- $i=1,\ldots,P$
