>Considering a $k$-dimensional affine space $L=x_0 + U$ of $V$, we know that every element $x\in L$ could be represented in a parametric equation form $$x = x_0 + \lambda_1 b_1+\ldots+\lambda_k b_k$$ with $b_i$ basis ordered element of $U$.

In $\mathbb{R}^n$, the $(n-1)$-dimensional affine subspaces are called **hyperplanes**. The parametric equation for a hyperplane is the following $$\begin{array}{l}y = x_0 + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\lambda_i b_i\\
\lambda\in\mathbb{R}\\
U= span[b_1]\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n
\end{array}$$

Where $b_1,\ldots,b_{n-1}$ form a basis of an $(n-1)$-dimensional subspace $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$

In fact a line is defined by
- a support point $x_0$
- $n-1$ linearly independent vectors $b_1,\ldots,b_{n-1}$ that span the direction space.

Hyperplanes has a very generic and abstract definition, in fact they are both hyperplane
- in $\mathbb{R}^2$, called lines
- in $\mathbb{R}^3$, called planes
