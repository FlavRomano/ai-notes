- Product of two matrices $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}, B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$ is $C=AB\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times k}$
	- we **multiply** elements of the $i$-th row of A with the $j$-th column of B
	- and **sum** them up
- In substance **we compute the dot product** of the corresponding row and column

- Matrices can only be multiplied $\iff$ their "neighboring" dimensions match
	- $A [n\times k] \implies B[k \times m]$
	- $B [k\times m] \centernot\implies A[n \times k]$
- Therefore, matrix multiplication is not commutative $$AB\neq BA$$
