Q: How "law of least effort" gets applied to cognitive exertion? 

E:
- If there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will choose the least demanding course of action.
- Effort is a cost, when we get skilled at some task we minimize cost $$quality\space of \space action=\frac{benefits}{costs}$$
C: The law of least effort dictates that if multiple cognitive paths can achieve the same goal, the mind will select the one requiring the least effort. Cognitive effort is treated as a cost, and as individuals become more skilled at a task, the mental energy demand diminishes, effectively minimizing the cost for the same benefit, thus aligning with the principle of choosing the least demanding option.
