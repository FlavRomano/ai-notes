- With linear algebra we study vectors and certain rules to manipulate vectors
- Geometric vector are denoted by small arrow notation $$\vec x, \vec y$$
- Vectors can be added together and multiplied by scalars to produce another vector. 
- Any object that satisfies these two properties can be considered a vector.
