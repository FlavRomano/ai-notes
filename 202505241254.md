As consequences of rank-nullity theorem that stands $$\dim(ker(\Phi)) + \dim(Im(\Phi)) = \dim(V)$$
- if $\dim(Im(\Phi)) < \dim(V) \implies \dim(\ker(\Phi)) \ge 1$
	- the kernel contains more than $0_V$
- if $A_\Phi$ is the transformation matrix of $\Phi$ with respect to an ordered basis and $\dim(Im(\Phi)) < \dim(V)$
	- the homogeneous system $A_\Phi x = 0$ ha infinitely many solutions
- if $\dim(V) = \dim(W)$ then $$\Phi\text{ is injective }\iff \Phi\text{ is surjective }\iff \Phi\text{ is bijective }$$ holds since $Im(\Phi) \subseteq W$.
