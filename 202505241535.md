>Considering a $k$-dimensional affine space $L=x_0 + U$ of $V$, we know that every element $x\in L$ could be represented in a parametric equation form $$x = x_0 + \lambda_1 b_1+\ldots+\lambda_k b_k$$ with $b_i$ basis ordered element of $U$.

One-dimensional affine subspaces are called **lines**. The parametric equation for a line is the following $$\begin{array}{l}y = x_0 + \lambda b_1\\
\lambda\in\mathbb{R}\\
U= span[b_1]\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n
\end{array}$$

In fact a line is defined by
- a support point $x_0$
- a vector $b_1$ that defines the direction.
