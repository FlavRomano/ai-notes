>Considering a $k$-dimensional affine space $L=x_0 + U$ of $V$, we know that every element $x\in L$ could be represented in a parametric equation form $$x = x_0 + \lambda_1 b_1+\ldots+\lambda_k b_k$$ with $b_i$ basis ordered element of $U$.

Two-dimensional affine subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are called **planes**. The parametric equation for a plane is the following $$\begin{array}{l}y = x_0 + \lambda_1 b_1 + \lambda_2 b_2\\
\lambda_1,\lambda_2\in\mathbb{R}\\
U= span[b_1,b_2]\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n
\end{array}$$

In fact a plane is defined by
- a support point $x_0$
- two linearly independent vectors $b_1$, $b_2$ that *span* the direction space.
