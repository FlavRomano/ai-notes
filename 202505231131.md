- Being a group itself, the vector space holds closure for every vector in $\mathcal{V}$
	- this property guarantees that we end up with another vector in the same vector space $V$
- it's possible to find a set of vectors with which 
	- we can represent every vector $x\in \mathcal{V}$ by adding them together and scaling them
	- this set of vectors is a **basis**
