The solution of a system of two linear equation with two variables
$$
\left\{ 
    \begin{array}{l}
        4x_1 + 4x_2 = 5 &\\
        2x_1 - 4x_2 = 1
    \end{array} 
\right.
$$
can be geometrically interpreted as the intersection of **two lines**
- every linear equation represents a line

- For three variables, each linear equation determines a plane in 3-dimensional space.
