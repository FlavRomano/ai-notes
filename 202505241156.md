Given linear mapping $\Phi: V\to W$ we define **kernel space** $$ker(\Phi) := \Phi^{-1}(0_W) = \{ v\in V\mid \Phi(v) = 0_W \}$$
is the set of vectors $v\in V$ that $\Phi$ **maps onto the neutral element $0_W\in W$**.

The kernel is the **general solution** to the homogeneous system of linear equations $$Ax = 0$$
- it captures **all possible linear combinations** of the elements in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that produce $0\in\mathbb{R}^m$
